# Tutorials

Welcome to the tutorials section of the Connected Interaction Kit! 

Here, you will find a comprehensive set of tutorials aimed at helping you take your first steps in working with microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. We included easy-to-follow instructions covering everything from setting up the tools needed to use your microcontroller to creating your first interaction and writing your first program. 

The tutorials below are partly also written up in the physical booklet included in the kit. [The PDF version of that booklet is available in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/id-studiolab/Connected-Interaction-Kit/blob/main/production_files/2024_edidion%20%28wip%29/booklet/2024_Kit_Booklet%28RGB_Digital_Publishing%29.pdf).
