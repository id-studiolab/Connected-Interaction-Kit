Detects the distance of objects directly in front of the sensor. Works best with white surfaces, for a range from 30 to 1200 mm. Works most reliably between 50 and 950 mm.

Both versions are functionally identical. The information in this article is valid no matter which version you own.

## Preparation

This Distance Sensor communicates with your microcontroller using a protocol called [I²C](/glossary/glossary). To work, it must be connected to a port labeled **I²C** on the BitsyExpander Board. You will need to include the `adafruit_bus_device` [library](/glossary/glossary) in your code to read data via I²C and the `adafruit_vl53l0x` library to control the [VL53L0X](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3317) sensor itself.

These libraries should already be installed on the ItsyBitsy Microcontroller included in your kit, so you don't need to worry about installing them yourself.

{: .highlight }
You can verify that these libraries are installed by ensuring a folder named `adafruit_bus_device` and a file called `adafruit_vl53l0x.mpy` are present in the `lib` folder of your `CIRCUITPY` drive. If not, download Adafruit's Library Bundle for Version 7.x [here](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). Extract the needed file and folder from the bundle and place them in the `lib` folder on your microcontroller. You can learn more about libraries and their use in the [Glossary](/glossary/glossary) or the [Tutorials](/Tutorials).

## Usage

Make sure to include `busio` and `adafruit_vl53l0x` in the imports section of your code to use the required libraries.  

The first step to using the sensor is setting up the connection by creating an `I2C` [object](/glossary/glossary) named `i2c_port`. Then, `dist_sensor = adafruit_vl53l0x.VL53L0X(i2c_port)` is used to create an [instance](/glossary/glossary) of the sensor named `dist_sensor` and connected to `i2c_port`. In the example code below, this is done in the _Variables_ section.

In the main loop, the `print()` function outputs distance readings retrieved from the sensor using `dist_sensor.range`, along with explanatory labels.

```python
# --- Imports
import time
import board
import busio
import adafruit_vl53l0x

# --- Variables
i2c_port = busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)
dist_sensor = adafruit_vl53l0x.VL53L0X(i2c_port)

# --- Functions

# --- Setup

# --- Main loop
while True:
    print("Range:", dist_sensor.range, "mm")
    time.sleep(0.1)
```
